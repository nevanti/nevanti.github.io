# Kirsi Nevanti

A filmmaker with several shorts and creative documentaries
under her belt, and a characteristic personal style. In her work as a director, Nevanti has learned that “good instincts usually tell you what to do before your
head has figured it out." Also, she says "Making documentaries is
interpreting reality; not necessarily as it appears to be; the key is
that the film must be ‘true to the spirit’ of what is portrayed.
