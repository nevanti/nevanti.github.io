      Kirsi Nevanti
    </h3>
    <p>


    A filmmaker with several shorts and creative documentaries
    under her belt, and a characteristic personal style. In her work as a director, Nevanti has learned that “good instincts usually tell you what to do before your
    head has figured it out." Also, she says "Making documentaries is
    interpreting reality; not necessarily as it appears to be; the key is
    that the film must be ‘true to the spirit’ of what is portrayed.

      <h5>Tomorrow Never Knows (2007). Feature lenght documentary.</h5>
      <p>
        At the beginning of Tomorrow Never Knows, we meet the subjects of this documentary as if they were characters in a feature film. The difference is that all elements of glamour or polished fiction are missing. Pontus and Marina, both homeless and wandering around Stockholm, used to be a couple. Their existence looks pretty hopeless, but you never know what tomorrow might bring. At the end of the film, they are both a little better off. The brilliant, mildly disturbed Pontus has even managed to get a job as a mathematician again. Director Kirsi Nevanti moves freely among her subjects (even crawling into bed with them in their trailer) and looks for the best cinematic means to express their feelings. To symbolise a breakthrough in Marina’s state of mind, Nevanti even uses short animated sequences. Although the subject of homeless people in a Scandinavian city promises little warmth, Nevanti succeeds in surprising with humour, sharp observations and beautiful shots of Stockholm; in part thanks to her liberal interpretation of the genre.

      <h5>Among The Elves. Original title En Släkting Till Älvorna. (1999). Feature lenght documentary.</h5>
      <p>

        En Släkting Till Älvorna is a film about the Swedish vocalist and living legend Freddie Wadling, an impressive and unusual character. A man who rather uninhibitedly turned from freak to virtuoso. The film is lyrical and impressionistic portrait describing Freddie Wadling’s interpretation of reality, setting the borders in between safe and sorry. As a child, he didn´t speak for seven years; as an adolescent, he embarked a carieer as a punk rocker, today with a rich bag of songs, he has done it all, including mediaval chant and the Kurt Weill canon. (Honorary mention Idfa Joris Ivens Competition 1999, Locarno Critics Week, 2000.)
